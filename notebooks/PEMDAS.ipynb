    "Order of Operations is an important skill taught to us as children when learning math.  A way our teachers taught us to memorize it was by saying: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. This stood for PEMDAS which stood for: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.  It is the order in which a math problem is to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the use of PEMDAS would be:\n",

    "$2\\times 2^2+(6\\times3)-2$\n",

    "You begin with the numbers in Parennthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "$2\\times2^2+18-2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then proceed with Exponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "$2\\times4+18-2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Multiplication.\n",

    "$8+18-2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip Division since there is none in the problem and proceed to Addition.\n",

    "$24-2$\n",
